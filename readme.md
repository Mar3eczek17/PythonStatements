# Warm Up Project Exercises
It is time to get me to put together all my skills to start building usable projects! Before I jump into full
milestone project, I will go through some warm-up component exercises, to get me comfortable with a few key ideas I use
in the milestone project and larger projects in general, specifically:

Getting User Input
Creating Functions that edit variables based on user input
Generating output
Joining User Inputs and Logic Flow


# Python Milestone Project Overview
- 2 players shoud be able to play the game (both sitting at the same computer)
- The board should be printed out every time a player makes a move
- You should be able to accept input of the player position and then place a symbol on the board

**Idea:
- I will use the "numpad" to match numbers to the grid on a tic tac toe board: 1-9
